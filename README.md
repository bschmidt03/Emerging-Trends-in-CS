# Emerging-Trends-in-CS
For this project, I built a Deep Q-Learning agent, the “pirate,” that learns to find the best path through a maze to reach the treasure. I was given the environment class (TreasureMaze.py) and the experience replay class (GameExperience.py), along with partial starter code in the notebook. My main task was to complete the Q-Training Algorithm, which trains the model using experience replay, epsilon-greedy exploration, and early stopping once the win rate improves. I confirmed that the model works correctly, but due to limited hardware, I could not let it run long enough to reach full convergence.

Computer scientists build systems that solve real-world problems by analyzing data, automating processes, and creating intelligent solutions. This project showed how reinforcement learning helps an agent make decisions in a complex environment without explicit instructions. It demonstrates how concepts from AI and neural networks apply to industries like robotics, logistics, and cybersecurity.

I approach problems by breaking them into smaller, testable steps. For this project, that meant studying how the agent interacts with the maze, designing the training loop, and adjusting rewards and parameters until it learned effectively. Careful analysis and iteration helped me create a functional learning system.

My ethical responsibility is to create systems that are fair, transparent, and reliable. Developers should protect user privacy, prevent bias, and ensure that intelligent systems are used responsibly. Even small projects like this reinforce the importance of building AI that benefits users and organizations safely.
